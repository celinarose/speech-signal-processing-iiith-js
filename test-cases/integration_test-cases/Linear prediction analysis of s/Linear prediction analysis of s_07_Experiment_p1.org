* Objective
  - To view the Experiment of the Linear prediction analysis of speech experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/speech-signal-processing-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Linear prediction analysis of s/Linear prediction analysis of s_01_Usability_smk.org][Linear prediction analysis of s_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Experiment link 
  2. Check if there are any distortions and junk characters in the Experiment page
  3. Select one of the sample .wav files provided and  give the spectrum and residual values click on the load button.
  4. Click on the play button and Click on record button
  5. Click on the stop button and then Click on play button. 
  6. Select the waveform and click on the play selection

* Expected result
  1. Experiment page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. The file should  be opened and spectrum,residual values should be generated
  4. The audio file should be loaded and video should start playing 
  5. The video should get recorded and when we click on the stop button the recording of the video should stop
  6. The recorded audio should be played
  7. The selected portion of the waveform should be played

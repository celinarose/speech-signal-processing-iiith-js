* Objective
  - To view the Experiment of the Nature of speech signal experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/speech-signal-processing-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Nature of speech signal_1.0/Nature of speech signal_1.0_01_Usability_smk.org][Nature of speech signal_1.0_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Experiment link 
  2. Check if there are any distortions and junk characters in the Experiment page
  3. Select the speaker and vowel and click on the submit button
